## Sublime settings

These are my sublime settings. To install these go to `Sublime Text
2/Packages/User` and do

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/madhums/sublime-settings.git .
```

Go back to packages folder and do

```sh
git clone https://github.com/buymeasoda/soda-theme/ "Theme - Soda"
```

You must install these two packages if you are a javascript developer
https://github.com/visionmedia/node.tmbundle and https://github.com/spadgos/sublime-jsdocs and https://github.com/visionmedia/mocha/tree/master/editors/JavaScript%20mocha.tmbundle
